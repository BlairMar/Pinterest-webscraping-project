## Image without CMD (With manuel user input)
1. ðŸ›  Before uploading the required files on an EC2 instance, create a directory named, for example, *Pinterest*.

2. ðŸ›  Using the command below and provided you are at the same level as the *EC2-Ubuntu-20.04* folder, upload the files from your PC to the EC2 instance:
   
   *scp -i </path/my-key-pair.pem> ./EC2-Ubuntu-20.04/\* ubuntu\@\<public-dns>\:\<path/>*

   The path in the EC2 instance would normally be *~/Pinterest* where *Pinterest* is the directory created previously.

3. ðŸ›  Log in to your EC2 instance.
4. ðŸ›  Moving into the *Pinterest* directory, run the following command:
   
   *sudo docker build -t \<image-name> .*
   
5. ðŸ›  The container can then be created using:

    *sudo docker container run -it --name \<container-name> --rm \<image-name>:latest*

## Automate input via CMD arguments

1. Steps 1. to 4. will be similar as above.

2. However, in this case, if a volume is beforehand created and then mounted to a container, the new command would be:

   *docker container run --name testremote --rm -v \<volume-name>:/app \<image-name>*

   This command will run the default arguments in the ***CMD*** part of the Dockerfile.

3. To add arbitrary inputs, add the arguments at the end of the last command in the same order as they are defined in the Dockerfile or the scraper will not work.
