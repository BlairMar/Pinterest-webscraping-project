1. ðŸ›  Before uploading the required files on an EC2 instance, create a directory named, for example, *Pinterest*.

2. ðŸ›  Using the command below and provided you are at the same level as the *EC2-Ubuntu-20.04* folder, upload the files from your PC to the EC2 instance:
   
   <span style="color:green">'scp -i </path/my-key-pair.pem> ./EC2-Ubuntu-20.04/\* ubuntu\@\<public-dns>\:\<path/>'</span>

   The path in the EC2 instance would normally be *~/Pinterest* where *Pinterest* is the directory created previously.

3. ðŸ›  Log in to your EC2 instance.
4. ðŸ›  Moving into the *Pinterest* directory, run the following command:
   
   <span style="color:green"> 'sudo docker build -t \<image-name> .'</span>
   
5. ðŸ›  The container can then be created using:

    <span style="color:green">'sudo docker container run -it --name \<container-name> --rm \<image-name>:latest'</span>
